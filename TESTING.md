## Testing
To check the validity of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python code, I used **[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)**, **[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)**, **[JSHint](https://jshint.com/)**, and **[Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)**.

Note on **PEP8 Testing**: Pylint throws errors regarding certain classes not having 'objects' members. After doing some research, I learned [that Django automatically creates classes, which Pylint does not recognize](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/class-question-has-no-objects-member-pylint-no-member/4024) and have decided to leave the error message.


### Client stories testing:

#### Testing client stories from UX section of the [READEME file](README.md)
Client stories were tested by going through the [User Stories Overview](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CRY7aYiLONmYjMFSnk4xuDKDCOrky4-98dOgRmqB0fU/edit?usp=sharing) and noting the results in the last column. The current version of the application works for all clients stories that are checked off. Stories that are not checked off require functionality that will be implemented in a future version. (See Features to Implement in the Future section of the [READEME file](README.md).)

## Bugs Discovered

### String Method not Working
```
def __string__(self):
        return self.name
```

#### Solution:
Changed to 

```
def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.name}'
```

based on information found in the documentation for [a flake8 plug-in](https://github.com/rocioar/flake8-django/wiki/%5BDJ08%5D-Model-does-not-define-__str__-method).


### ``` NOT NULL constraint failed ```

```
NOT NULL constraint failed: home_item.childAge2
```

#### Solution: 
```
"blank=True" "null=True" 
````

require an additional ``` default value ```.


### URLs in Penpals App not Accessible

Despite creating all the urlpaths, the pages could not be found

#### Solution:
Based on on this [Stackoverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55429392/django-url-pattern-not-being-found), I was able to modify the urlpaths and get them to work.
